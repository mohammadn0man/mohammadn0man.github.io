    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle"><strong>Munajaat Nomani</strong> &mdash; Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Assuffa Academy (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) built Munajaat Nomani (package name <code>com.nomani.munajaat</code>) as a free mobile application for Android and iOS. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app. By using Munajaat Nomani you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or process any personal or personally identifiable information.</strong> Munajaat Nomani does not require account creation, sign-in, or registration of any kind. We do not ask for or access your name, email address, phone number, location, device identifiers, or any other personal data.</p>
    <p>All supplication (dua/munajaat) content &mdash; including Arabic text, English translations, and Urdu translations &mdash; is bundled within the app or stored locally on your device. We do not access, collect, or transmit this content.</p>

    <h2>Network Requests and Version Check</h2>
    <p>The only network request the app makes is a periodic check to determine whether a newer version of the app is available. This request fetches a small, publicly hosted JSON file from GitHub (<code>version.json</code>) containing the latest version number and an optional update message.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No user identifiers, device IDs, IP-based tracking, or personal data of any kind are sent with this request.</strong></li>
      <li>The request is a standard HTTP GET to a public URL. We do not log or store any information about the devices that make this request.</li>
      <li>If the request fails (for example, due to no internet connection), the app continues to function normally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal information, there is nothing to use. The version-check response is used solely to compare your installed app version with the latest available version and, if necessary, prompt you to update.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not share any data with third parties.</strong> The app contains no analytics services, advertising networks, or third-party SDKs that collect data. There are no in-app purchases or payment processing. We have no data to share, sell, or disclose.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Because we do not collect or store any personal data on our servers, there is no personal data at risk. Your preferences and favorites are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Munajaat Nomani is a native mobile application. We do not use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or any other tracking technologies.</p>

    <h2>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Munajaat Nomani is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since the app does not collect personal information from any user, no special measures are required. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it promptly. If we update the app to specifically target children, we will comply with applicable laws, including the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and update this policy accordingly.</p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>Munajaat Nomani is available to users worldwide. Since we do not collect personal data, regional data-protection regulations such as the European Union&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are limited in practical application to this app. If you are located in the European Economic Area or another jurisdiction that grants specific data-privacy rights, those rights are fully respected &mdash; and largely moot &mdash; because we hold no personal data about you.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date at the top of this page. The current version of this policy will always be available at:</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/mohammadn0man/manajaat/blob/master/PRIVACY.md">https://github.com/mohammadn0man/manajaat/blob/master/PRIVACY.md</a></p>
    <p>We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>
